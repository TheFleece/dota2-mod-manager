// What the scheduled catalog run should call its commit.
//
// That workflow runs every half hour and pushes when the upstream catalog moved, which is
// around a hundred and twenty commits so far, every one of them titled "Update mod
// fingerprints and hero pages". A quarter of this repository's history says nothing about
// itself. Line-broken files (tools/json-lines.js) fixed the diff; this fixes the subject.
//
// It compares two versions of fingerprints.json and counts mods, not fingerprints: two
// catalog entries that ship the same file share one fingerprint, so counting keys would
// under-report the day a mod is re-uploaded under a second name.
//
// Usage:  node tools/index-delta.js <before.json> <after.json>
// Prints one line. Nothing here fails the build: an unreadable file gives the neutral
// message, because a bot that cannot describe its commit should still make it.
