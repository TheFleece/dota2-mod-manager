// mods.json keeps most categories as an array of mods and five of them as
// { groups: [ { id, name, mods: [...] } ] }: hero-items, item-effects, creeps, creep-deny and
// towers. Every tool in this repository that reads the catalog has to know that, and until
// 2026-09-10 three of them each knew it separately. Two were right. tools/r2-sync.mjs skipped
// anything that was not an array, so 313 mods of 1,336 had never reached the mirror, and the
// gap was invisible because the site and the fingerprint index looked complete.
//
// Styles are left to the caller. A mod with several styles is one archive to the mirror and
// several entries to the site, so there is no single right answer and this does not invent one.
