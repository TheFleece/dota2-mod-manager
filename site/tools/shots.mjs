/**
 * Phone-sized copies of the pictures, so a phone decodes phone-sized pixels.
 *
 * The screenshots ship at 1360x860 and the creator thumbnail at 1280x720, and both are shown
 * about 333 pixels wide on a phone. Without a smaller copy the browser decodes the full frame
 * anyway: 1.2 megapixels each, held in memory, three screenshots plus the thumbnail arriving
 * one after another as somebody scrolls. That is what "a problem repeatedly occurred" is on
 * iOS - Safari killing the tab over memory rather than any single mistake on the page.
 *
 * Written into dist/ rather than committed, the way the mod previews are: these are derived
 * from files already in the repository and a second copy in git would only drift.
